url-shortener-tinyurl was created as a Python Flask web application that provides a user-friendly interface for shortening URLs using the TinyURL API. The app features a modern, Apple-inspired design and allows users to input a long URL, which is then shortened and displayed on the page. Additionally, each time a URL is shortened, the app sends a notification with the shortened URL to a specified Slack webhook.
